# Monitor-Immersive-LED

Welcome in the wonderfull world of immersion for PC user. This Monitor immersive LED project will make you go inside your game, movie or if you like it as much as I do fireplace background.

We make a device that will catch colors display on your monitor and will project them, thank to LED behind it. This faithfully reproduces all around the monitor the colors there is on your screen. So all the wall behind your monitor will become the extension of your screen.

What you will need to do this device (what we used):
	- Arduino nano
	- Micro usb
	- NÃ©oPixels Digital RGB LED strip (60 LED)
	- Power supply with 5V and 2A or 3A

You can use any bigger arduino card if you want.

The micro USB will be usefull to connect the arduino the the computer.

For the LED strip you must have digitally-addressable LEDS, you can find cheaper led strip that could feet on amazon or other seller.


How we put it behind our monitor?

This is our shame and you will probably find much better way to do it. For the strip to follow the shape of the monitor you will have to cut it into 4 pieces and solder them in the shape you want. I advise a square and you must start by the bottom right than top, left, and bottom. Once this square is made you can use scotch on piece without led to attach it to the behind of your monitor.

I wish you good luck in your quest to make it, you will be happy with it I garante it.
